ISO Chain Loader
================

A bootable ISO image for ppc64le systems that mimics network boot
functionality, allowing the user to select and install a Linux distribution
over the network.

Development
-----------

Development is supported on an x86_64 Linux host with Python 3.14 and just
1.57 or newer. Set up the isolated Python environment and install the Git hook:

```sh
just setup
```

Run the same aggregate checks used by continuous integration:

```sh
just check
```

The check command, local hooks, and continuous integration do not modify repository files. Apply
safe Python and Markdown fixes explicitly, then run the full checks, with:

```sh
just fix
```

The installed pre-commit hooks run the focused checks when committing. To run
all configured hooks directly, use:

```sh
.venv/bin/pre-commit run --all-files
```

Secret checks compare current tracked content with the reviewed `.secrets.baseline`; updating that
baseline is a separate review action. Python type checking will be added when the repository has
explicit Python source paths.

The ISO output targets ppc64le. Building bootable media additionally requires
ppc64le-capable GNU binutils, GRUB image tooling, and `xorriso`; `just setup`
does not install these target build tools.

End-to-end validation requires either a ppc64le emulator or a real ppc64le
system. The local checks and continuous integration workflow do not build or
validate bootable media.
